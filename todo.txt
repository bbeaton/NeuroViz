BUGS:
- Sampling rate seems off.  
	- Only recording 1 piece of data per second!  But raw data is fuctioning properly
	- rerun original program to see how deep this error goes
	- look at rewriting the Mindset package (Mindset class connect() and newdata())

FEATURES:
Implement engagement calculations in real time
